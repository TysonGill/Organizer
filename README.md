# Organizer

Organizer is a desktop utility that I've used for many, many years. It is a place I can throw all those miscellaneous notes, registrations, passwords, web links, reminders, and really any sort of info that doesn't fit well anywhere else.

It lets you easily create a page and organize it in a treeview. Text can be formatted with Rich Text fonts, styles, and colors.

You can associate a web or file link with the notes and jump to that directly. Since the storage is file-based, you can install it on different computers and access shared info through a shared drive.

It does what it does pretty well but it could certainly be extended a great deal.
